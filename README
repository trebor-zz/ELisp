First tests with emacs & git.  

Somehow it seems that emacs does not really work with git (despite
what the Info-files or the emacs wiki say.).

At the end of many days, more questions than answers remain:

Which vc-git.el is more recent - the one coming with emacs23(cvs) or
the one coming with git-core?

What does vc-git.el provide (regarding to remote-repositories)?
What is the stash?
What is the master-file?
How does one  git push/pull/branch/....?
